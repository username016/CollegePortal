Proposal

PROG30000 PROPOSAL
Group name: Shawarma Group
Title: College Portal Management Website
Group Includes:
Yueyang Ding Student # 991661988,
Mohammad Raja Student # 991727878,
Ayat Al-Azzawi Student #991710835
A short description:
Our project would cover a web portal where students can access multiple services and
information within the college they are attending similar to Slate. For the functionalities
of this project we would include online study room booking, gym availability in terms of
sport events, tutor services availability and lost and found system.
Our project plan and who is responsible for what:
Of course we are going to help each other but this is where we define where majority of
our work will be done individually
Yueyang Ding —> Front end and user interface.
Most likely going to tackle our UI what is suppose to look like first then moving on with
Mohammad Raja —> Back-end development
Back-end development ensuring the logic behind the purpose of the UI works as it
should so it can be stored and authenticated by
Ayat Al-Azzawi —> Database management and Security.
Going to be storing and querying the right information for our users and ensuring
security with authentication for a safe experience.
Tools that we are going to be using:
● Code developed using Visual Studio 2022
● Frameworks to be used
○ ASP.NET Core MVC
○ Entity Framework for model persistence to database
○ Web API for web services (Optional)
● Data formats:
○ SQL Server and/or SQLite for relational database
Contributions/deliverables of the project:
Combine multiple different similar booking systems all in one website, more convenient
for users and students to have quick booking and access to many types of events. If we
have time we will try to incorporate some AI capabilities like an assistant to randomly
generate the best schedule of events for students.



Requirements: 

Content Requirements
The project must demonstrate the use of layered approach as below:
1. A presentation layer consisting of at least 4-6 views that are significant from the point of view of
interactivity with the user. This shall allow each team member to practice the interactivity
mechanisms studied in class.
2. A business logic layer consisting of at least 2-3 significant business use-cases implemented by 4-
6 business logic classes other than the user interface classes developed for Part 1.
3. A data layer that uses a database to persist the data.

Technology Requirements
1. Code developed using Visual Studio 2022
2. Frameworks to be used
a. ASP.NET Core MVC
b. Entity Framework for model persistence to database
c. Web API for web services (Optional)
3. Data formats:
a. SQL Server and/or SQLite for relational database


Principles and Best Practices
a. Object-Oriented Design. The application shall demonstrate the application of the best
principles of object-oriented design:
i. Information hiding / encapsulation
ii. Code reuse through inheritance
iii. Reuse through abstraction and polymorphism
iv. Loose coupling, separation of concerns
v. Simple, cohesive classes and methods
b. A visual design (e.g., UML diagram) should be created for the project.
c. Coding conventions and industry standard, following, but not limited to,
i. MVC design pattern and coding conventions
i. Scope prefixes conventions (e.g. use of _prefix for any field)
iii. Naming conventions: For example, names start with capital letters for classes
and methods and properties and start with a small letter for variables and fields.
iv. Descriptive names for classes, methods and variables
d. Commenting. The code shall be commented according to the following requirements
i. Each class shall have a header with the principal author of the code and a short
description of what the code in the file is for
ii. Each method and field shall be commented with XML style comments and
include a brief description of the purpose of method and field. If the Author of
the method is different than the author of the class, the author name shall also
be included in method headers
iii. The code (inside methods) shall be commented to explain WHY the code is
there (not necessarily how and what) wherever necessary.


Project Presentation
Prepare a 10 min presentation of the project. Some basic requirements of the presentation:
a. Present the purpose of the application.
b. Demonstrate the application’s functionality. Each student in the group shall demo the
functionality they worked on.
c. Demonstrate the architecture of the project (e.g., layers, MVC, data), walkthrough the
code of critical parts.
d. Identify how the project meets the requirements identified in this document:
i. Content requirements
ii. Technology requirements
iii. Principles and best Practices
e. Prepare a video presentation of the project. Submit the link of the video along with the
project.
Projects missing the presentation and/or video presentation may not be marked.


Self and Peer Evaluation
Every member of a group MUST individually submit a self and peer evaluation document. In this
document the member should comment on his/her contribution and the contributions made by every
other member. Contribution by other members should be reported by the name of each member, not as
a team/combine.
